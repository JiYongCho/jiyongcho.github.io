I research `user engagement` in the online space, primarily a venue related to learning and knowledge acquisition, such as online courses, communities, and learning technologies.  

My work aims to:
`Understand` users' online behaviors and motivational factors for engaging in certain behaviors, including cultural backgrounds, perceptions, beliefs, and mindsets.
`Design` interventions to help users continue to engage in their desired behaviors online and achieve goals.
`Create` tools for learning and sharing knowledge online.

My ultimate goal is to revolutionize how we learn and share knowledge online, making the process more engaging and effective for all users.

I am currently a Ph.D. resident at LG AI Research. In the Advanced Machine Learning lab, I work on building large language models that are trustworthy and inspiring to experts or knowledge workers.
