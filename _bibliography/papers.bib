abstract = {K-8 mathematics students must learn many procedures, such as addition and subtraction. Students frequently learn "buggy' variations of these procedures, which we ideally could identify automatically. This is challenging because there are many possible variations that reflect deep compositions of procedural thought. Existing approaches for K-8 math use manually specified variations which do not scale to new math algorithms or previously unseen misconceptions. Our system examines students' answers and infers how they incorrectly combine basic skills into complex procedures. We evaluate this approach on data from approximately 300 students. Our system replicates 86\% of the answers that contain clear systematic mistakes (13\%). Investigating further, we found 77\% at least partially replicate a known misconception, with 53\% matching exactly. We also present data from 29 participants showing that our system can demonstrate inferred incorrect procedures to an educator as successfully as a human expert.},

  abstract={The abrupt transition to online instruction has created an opportunity to improve models of online instruction. We investigated changes in student grades and experiences during emergency online learning (spring 2020) and sustainable online learning a year later (spring 2021) relative to a pre-pandemic in-person semester (spring 2019). We examine variation in outcomes by student sex, first-generation college student status, and ethnic-minority status to understand the consequences for educational equity. For students enrolled in four undergraduate courses at a U.S. research university, we combined student survey responses (N = 1290) with registrar records (N = 2375). We found that students received higher grades on average during emergency online learning, but the transition to sustainable online learning significantly exacerbated the achievement gap for ethnic-minority students. While the overall course experience improved going from emergency to sustainable online learning, we found differences between identity-based groups. Overall, historically disadvantaged students experienced lasting negative effects following the disruption. Student experiences and learning outcomes should therefore be monitored and supported to avoid exacerbating educational inequities during prolonged periods of online learning.}

abstract = {One of the most effective ways to learn a second language is to immerse oneself in it in the country where it is spoken. While this is not feasible for most language learners, language learning games may be able to replicate an immersive language learning experience. We developed Delivery Ghost, a web-based game to teach Mandarin Chinese to beginner-level learners, including complete beginners. In a 2x2 experiment (N=159), we tested how immersion and interactivity affect learning gains (pre-post test) and experiences (enjoyment, flow, perceived learning, cognitive load). Participants in all conditions showed significant learning gains even though no explicit, lecture-style teaching was provided. We also found evidence of substantial learning gains and positive learning experiences independent of the level of immersion (i.e., availability of hints in English) and interactivity (i.e., animation vs. gameplay). These results suggest that interactivity and immersion are less critical to learning at the beginner-level than a well-structured curriculum.},

We study changes in students' experience of support from their instructors and peers in large lecture courses. Social support can act as an important resource for students and buffer against mental distress. We find that students experienced more support from instructors but less support from their peers after the transition to remote instruction. Remote learning was less active and involved fewer peer interactions, with synchronous classes resembling online office hours and students struggling to get help. Our findings suggest the need for additional resources to help students stay connected and facilitate collaboration online.},

  abstract={Online courses are increasingly used to scale up professional learning. However, engaging people throughout a course and encouraging them to take actions afterward is challenging, especially with culturally diverse participants whose response to encouragement may vary. Social norms can serve as a strong encouragement to participants, but they are mostly unobservable in online courses. We therefore tested how communicating three established kinds of social norms impacts behavioral outcomes and how the effects vary across different cultures. Findings from a randomized controlled field experiment in a Massive Open Online Course entitled Nature Education show that both the type of norm message (descriptive; dynamic; injunctive) and the cultural context (China; US) influence how the intervention improves course outcomes: US participants' completion rate rose 40% following an injunctive norm message stating that participants ought to conduct nature education, while other norm messages were ineffective for both US and Chinese participants. Regardless of the social norm message, nearly all participants engaged in nature education activities within three months after the course ended. Communicating social norms can impact participants' behavior in the course and beyond, which can offer a strategy for supporting online professional learning and tailoring messages to different cultural contexts.}

This work offers valuable insights for supporting learners in educational contexts, especially for improving self-regulation and goal-directed behaviors like completing a course of study--a persistent issue in formal and information post-secondary education. We present the widely adopted Behavior Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy as a model for systematically cataloging interventions in education and as a resource for inspiring new interventions in education based on public health evidence. Approaching the issue of learner attrition from the BCT perspective, we show how recent educational interventions fit into the BCT taxonomy and how the taxonomy can be used to develop new evidence-based intervention approaches. Borrowing insights from decades of public health research can advance parallel efforts in education to help learners at scale to stay on track and reach their academic goals.},

  abstract={Assessments in higher education can help instructors understand their students' incoming knowledge and learning gains. Constructing and validating assessments is especially challenging in emergent, fast-growing interdisciplinary STEM fields such as information science. Unlike more traditional STEM fields like physics and mathematics, information science builds on cross-disciplinary connections with multiple pools of domain knowledge. This research investigates how to construct and use assessments to effectively capture knowledge and skills in information science. Our study was conducted in five large information science courses at a U.S. research university on data analytics, web development, visualization, technology design, and natural language processing. We worked with domain experts to develop assessment items at three levels of knowledge: declarative, applied, and transferred (Anderson et al., 2002). The assessments were administered in a pre-post design over two semesters with 1,202 students, with an evidence-based revision of the assessments between the semesters. Our initial findings suggest that some knowledge levels (applied and transferred) may be more suitable for assessing student learning in information science courses. The findings have implications for assessment in emergent interdisciplinary education and inform our plans to develop constructive assessment methods for information science education.}

The resulting cultural diversity in online courses has implications for learning preferences, behaviors and outcomes, but established measures of culture are not adapted to educational contexts. We adapted and tested a survey instrument of cultural dimensions of learning that is grounded in cultural psychology research and spans four dimensions: knowledge construction, pedagogical orientation, uncertainty tolerance, and consensus building. We collected 600 responses in two online courses, conducted an explanatory factor analysis, and compared responses across five countries. We found that the instrument has a clear factor structure with high internal consistency, and it can distinguish cultures between countries. The instrument can be used to better understand learners and their culture in the process of course design and evaluation.},

abstract = {Educators and researchers in online education have grappled with not only how to increase course completion but also how to make a broader impact that goes beyond online courses, such as course participants' real-world applications of the learned knowledge and skills. Research in social psychology and behavioral science suggests that social norms interventions, which convey norms shared in the community that people belong in to promote desirable behaviors, can offer a low-cost and scalable approach to encourage actions beyond the courses (ABCs). We tested three social norm interventions that presented a weekly normative message (descriptive, dynamic, or injunctive norm) with aggregate information about course participants' ABCs in the prior week. Randomized experiments in three online courses found effects on ABCs to be weak and moderated by norm message type and the complexity of the target behavior. Although the interventions did not improve course completion, the dynamic norm message was more effective at promoting ABCs for complex behaviors, such as developing environmental education activities.},

abstract = {The links between music and computation date back at least three decades. This trend has led to the development of learning environments for novices to make music and learn computational concepts. However, research connecting music and computation is mostly situated within the context of on-screen programming, with little research involving hybrid, tangible environments. Electronic textiles (e-textiles) is one such hybrid context where learners craft interactive physical artifacts by sewing microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators onto toys, clothes, or other fabric accessories. Prior studies show that Arduino-based e-textiles afford opportunities for students to learn basic concepts such as variables and control flow but not more advanced concepts such as arrays and for loops. In our study, we expand learning with e-textiles as learners compose and code music to address the following research question: What are the affordances of designing musical wearables to deepen computational conceptual learning? We present a case study of a group of four 15-17-year-old youth and an adult co-making a musical wearable-JazzHands-a glove augmented with actuators such as LEDs and speaker, and motion, touch, and light sensors. We analyzed videos of the group's collaborative design sessions, student daily journals, multiple versions of the code, and post-workshop, artifact-based interviews with the youth. Our analysis revealed that making musical wearables not only allowed the youth to express themselves and relate to computing as a creative endeavor but also afforded unique opportunities to work with constructs such as arrays indices, sensor data integration, and logical expressions to control for loops.},

abstract = {Planning is a self-regulated learning strategy and widely used behavior change technique that can help learners achieve academic goals (e.g., pass an exam, apply to college, or complete an online course). Numerous studies have tested the effects of planning interventions, but few have examined the content of learners' plans and how it relates to their academic outcomes. Building on a large-scale intervention study, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of 650 learner plans sampled from 15 massive open online courses (MOOCs). We identified a number of planning tactics, compared their prevalence, and examined which ones significantly predict course progress and completion using regression analyses. We found that learners whose plans specify a time of day (e.g., morning, afternoon, night) are significantly more likely to complete a MOOC, but only 25\% of the learners in our sample used this tactic. The high degree of variation in the effectiveness of planning tactics may contribute to mixed intervention findings in scale-up studies. Models of plan effectiveness can be used to provide feedback on the quality of learners' plans and encourage them to use effective tactics to achieve their learning goals.},
