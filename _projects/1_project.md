We ran a series of studies collaborating with the marketing team from <a href="https://ecornell.cornell.edu/">eCornell</a>, an online course provider, to examine what types of ads encourage women to enroll in STEM courses 

In Study 1, we conducted an online field experiment study and found that a skill-oriented message compared to a career-oriented message increased younger women's (age 18-29) enrollment in web programming. 

In study 2, we also found a skill-oriented message compared to a career-oriented message was positively associated with younger women's (age 18-29) enrollment in another STEM course, commercial real estate, in the previous advertisement data. 

In study 3, we conducted an online lab study, and our two key findings are: (1) motivation for course enrollment is significantly lower for younger women when they perceive the course as more masculine, and (2) a skill-oriented message than a career-oriented one significantly decreased younger womenâ€™s level of perceived masculinity about the advertised course.
